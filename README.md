# TicTacToe
A simple game of tic tac toe where 2 players complete to get 3 in a row. Will add more to the readme as the project develops

Main method calles the gameBoard.game() method and plays until there's a winner or tie.

Allows for 1 or 2 players. If 1 then playing against computer

Code is a bit messy and can definitely be revised later
